    "content": "0001 From Abraham Lincoln to Truman Smith 1 , November 10, 1860 1 See Smith to Lincoln, November 7, 1860, and Smith to Lincoln, November 8, 1860.\n\nSmith called Lincoln's attention to a circular distributed before the election by ârespectable citizens of New York,â in which Lincoln was held up as a dangerous radical and an enemy of the institutions of the South and of the peace and security of the Union, whose policies were unsettling to the commercial life of the country.\n\nSuch a message, typical as it was of the sort of vituperation a presidential candidate must endure, was especially unsettling in the current campaign, and would have a negative influence in the South as well as among Northern voters.\n\nOnce elected, Smith asked, should Lincoln not speak out to âdisarm the mischief makers, to allay causeless anxiety, to compose the public mind...?â (copy) Private & Confidential .\n\nSpringfield Ill Nov 10th 1860.\n\nMy dear Sir This is intended as a strictly private letter to you, and not as an answer to yours brought me by Mr.\n\nSanford. 2 It is with the most profound appreciation of your motive, and highest respect for your judgment too, that I feel constrained, for the present, at least, to make no declaration for the public. 2 Smith's first letter to Lincoln, of November 7, 1860, was carried by Henry S.\n\nSanford.\n\nSee Smith to Lincoln, November 8, 1860.\n\nFirst, I could say nothing which I have not already said, and which is in print, and open for the inspection of all.\n\nTo press a repetition of this upon those who have listened, is useless; to press it upon those who have refused to listen, and still refuse, would be wanting in self-respect, and would have an appearance of sycophancy and timidity, which would excite the contempt of good men, and encourage bad ones to clamor the more loudly.\n\nI am not insensible to any commercial or financial depression that may exist; but nothing is to be gained by fawning around the â respectable scoundrels â who got it up.\n\nLet them go to work and repair the mischief of their own making; and then perhaps they will be less greedy to do the like again.\n\nYours very truly A.\n\nLincoln."

We are met on a great battle field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of it, as a final resting place for those who died here, that the nation might live. This we may, in all propriety do. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow, this ground—The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have hallowed it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here; while it can never forget what they did here.\n\nIt is rather for us, the living, we here be dedicated to the great task remaining before us —that, from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here, gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve these dead shall not have died in vain; that the nation, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people by the people for the people, shall not perish from the earth."

    "content": "0001 Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address 1 , [March 4, 1865] 1 The only known manuscript of Lincoln's famous Second Inaugural Address, this document appears to be a fair copy, rather than a composition draft.\n\nIts large lettering and well-spaced lines suggest it was copied out fair as a reading copy.\n\nThis is confirmed by the revision he made to the address's ending, which could have been effected by inserting additional words between the lines.\n\nInstead, he made the revision by pasting a slip of paper, or tab, over the last two lines of his text and writing the revised version on the tab.\n\nAt some point it was decided to make printed copies available to the press.\n\nThe name written in pencil in the top margin of the first page of the manuscript, âFlynn,â is almost certainly that of the typesetter assigned by the printer to set the manuscript into type.\n\nAfter proofreading the galleys of what would become a three-page printed handout for the press, Lincoln seems to have retained a set of uncorrected galleys and fashioned this into his reading copy.\n\nHe did this by cutting the printed galleys up into smaller segments (mostly consisting of one sentence), arranging them into two columns, and pasting them onto a larger sheet.\n\nThe text of this reading copy shows two verbal changes, which are present also in the manuscript copy, and many punctuation changes, which are not.\n\nThis is presumably the text that Lincoln read from at the inaugural ceremony at the Capitol on March 4, 1865.\n\nFor more details on the manuscript, the three-page printed press handout, and the reading copy, see David C.\n\nMearns and Lloyd A.\n\nDunlap, Library of Congress Press Release, Feb. 8, 1965.\n\nBoth manuscript and reading copy were presented by the president to John Hay and were in turn presented by his family to the Library of Congress in 1916.\n\nThe text of the manuscript is followed by that of the reading copy. [ Manuscript copy ] Fellow Countrymen 2 2 In pencil, possibly in another hand.\n\nAt this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first.\n\nThen a statement, somewhat in detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper.\n\nNow, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention, and engrosses the enerergies of the nation, little that is new could be presented.\n\nThe progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all.\n\nWith high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\n\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil-war.\n\nAll dreaded it â all sought to avert it.\n\nWhile the inaugeral address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war â seeking to dissole the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation.\n\nBoth parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather than let it perish.\n\nAnd the war came.\n\nOne eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern half part of it.\n\nThese slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.\n\nAll knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war.\n\nTo strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.\n\nNeither party expected for the war, the magnitude, or the duration, which it has already attained.\n\nNeither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease.\n\nEach looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding.\n\nBoth read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other.\n\nIt may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged.\n\nThe prayers of both could not be answered; that of neither has been answered fully.\n\nThe Almighty has His own purposes. âWoe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!â If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offences which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a Living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope â fervently do we pray â that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.\n\nYet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-manâs two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said f [ our ] three thousand years ago, so still it must be said âthe judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogetherâ With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan â to achieve and cherish a lasting peace among ourselves and with the world. to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with the world. all nations. 3 3 Lincoln revised his text by covering the last two lines (âto achieve . . .the world.â) with a tab, on which he wrote the revised ending (âto do all . . . the world.â).\n\nA further change was made on the tab itself by striking âthe worldâ and substituting âall nations.â [ Endorsed by Lincoln: ] Original manuscript 4 of second Inaugeral presented to Major John Hay. 4 Lincoln's characterization of this document as the âoriginal manuscriptâ must be regarded with some latitude, as the manuscript gives every evidence of being a fair copy, made from an earlier composition draft.\n\nIt is undoubtedly the manuscript from which the printed reading copy was set.\n\nA.\n\nLincoln April 10, 1865 [ Printed Reading Copy ] 5 5 Whether Lincoln planned to have his manuscript set up in print to read from, or decided to take advantage of the advance printing for the press handout, is not known.\n\nComparison with the press handout shows this reading copy to be an uncorrected galley proof in which the printer had already made a number of minor changes in spelling, capitalization, and punctuation, many of which Lincoln accepted.\n\nThe additional punctuation, particularly the commas added at this late stage, probably reflects Lincoln's characteristic concern for the most effective pace and delivery.\n\nA list of all changes appears at the end of the text.\n\nFELLOW COUNTRYMEN: At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first.\n\nThen, a statement, somewhat in detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper.\n\nNow, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth, on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention, and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented.\n\nThe progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all.\n\nWith high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\n\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war.\n\nAll dreaded it â all sought to avert it.\n\nWhile the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war â seeking to dissolve the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation.\n\nBoth parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather than let it perish.\n\nAnd the war came.\n\nOne-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern half part of it.\n\nThese slaves constituted a peculiar, and powerful interest.\n\nAll knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war.\n\nTo strengthen, perpetuate and extend this interest, was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed no right to do more, than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.\n\nNeither party expected for the war, the magnitude, or the duration, which it has already attained.\n\nNeither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease.\n\nEach looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding.\n\nBoth read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other.\n\nIt may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not, that we be not judged.\n\nThe prayers of both could not be answered â that of neither, has been answered fully.\n\nThe Almighty has His own purposes. â Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh.â If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offences which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove; and that He gives to both north and south this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope â fervently do we pray â that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.\n\nYet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, âthe judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.â With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan â to do all which may achieve and cherish, a just and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with the world. all nations. 6 6 Lincoln made a great many changes on this galley proof, many of which do not appear in the three-page press handout.\n\nThis suggests that Lincoln made most of these changes after he had made corrections on another set of corrected galleys sent to the printer.\n\nDifferences between this text and that of the holograph manuscript are of two types: A.\n\nChanges made by Lincoln to his own manuscript text.\n\nB.\n\nChanges made by the printer, some of which were accepted and some rejected by Lincoln.\n\nA list of the changes in each category follows: A.\n\nChanges made here by Lincoln to his manuscript text: Word changes: âhalfâ changed to âpartâ; âthe worldâ changed to âall nationsâ (these changes were also made in the manuscript).\n\nCommas added after âcalled forthâ; âpeculiarâ; âthis interestâ; âto do moreâ; âthat of neitherâ; âcherishâ.\n\nSemi-colon substituted for comma after âwills to removeâ.\n\nB.\n\nChanges made by the printer: Accepted by Lincoln : comma added after âThenâ; âcivil warâ for manuscript's âcivil-warâ; âenergiesâ for the manuscript's âenerergiesâ;âinauguralâ for the manuscript's âinaugeralâ; âdissolveâ for the manuscript's âdissoleâ; âOne-eighthâ for manuscript's âOne eighthâ; comma deleted after âperpetuateâ; comma added after âjudge notâ; dash after âansweredâ (substituted for Lincoln's semi-colon); period after âcomethâ (substituted for Lincoln's exclamation point); initial capitals changed to lower case in âsouthernâ, âslaveryâ, ânorthâ, âsouthâ, and âlivingâ; comma after ânorth and southâ deleted; comma after âcontinueâ deleted; âbondman'sâ for manuscript's âbond-man'sâ; comma added after âmust be saidâ; comma after âLordâ deleted; period added after âaltogetherâ; comma after âcherish a justâ deleted.\n\nRejected by Lincoln : Comma deleted after âattentionâ restored by Lincoln; comma substituted for semi-colon after âeven by warâ changed back to semi-colon by Lincoln; comma deleted after âfor the warâ restored by Lincoln; comma deleted after âmagnitudeâ restored by Lincoln; comma deleted after âdurationâ restored by Lincoln; comma deleted after âtriumphâ restored by Lincoln; comma deleted after âBibleâ restored by Lincoln; semi-colon changed to comma after âsame Godâ restored by Lincoln; comma deleted after âlashâ restored by Lincoln; comma deleted after âlasting peaceâ restored by Lincoln."
